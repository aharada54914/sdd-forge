# Quality Gate

Use after `implement-task` has set a task to `Implementation Complete`.

## Preconditions

If `AGENTS.md` is absent at the repository root, stop immediately and direct
the user to run `/sdd-bootstrap:sdd-adopt`; do not proceed without it.
Missing `reports/quality-gate/` or `docs/review-tickets/` directories may be
created on the fly before continuing.

## Required Reading

Read the task, implementation report, requirements, design, acceptance tests,
traceability, contracts, ADRs, Git diff, and all bundled references, including
`deterministic-check-policy.md`, `evaluation-rubric.md`, `risk-gate-matrix.md`,
`risk-classification-policy.md`, and
`plugins/sdd-quality-loop/references/quality-gate-calibration.md`.

## Process

1. Reject any target not in `Implementation Complete`.
2. Create the Default-FAIL verification contract for the task from
   `templates/verification-contract.template.json` following
   `deterministic-check-policy.md`. Treat the implementation report as a
   claim, not as evidence.
3. Compare the implementation and report with the approved task and source artifacts.
4. Detect and run all available CI-equivalent checks using `verification-policy.md`.
   Save real command output as evidence and update the contract.
5. Verify tests using `test-policy.md`.
6. Run the scripted gates with `scripts/*.sh` or `scripts/*.ps1`, in this order:
   - `check-risk` on the task: confirms a valid `Risk:` tier, a non-empty
     `Risk Rationale:`, and — for `high`/`critical` — `Required Workflow: tdd`.
     The tier selects the required-check set per `risk-gate-matrix.md`.
   - `check-placeholders` on the changed production files only.
   - `check-workflow-state` without `--feature`: validates the canonical
     persisted-state invariant for every registered specification.
   - `check-task-state` on tasks.md.
   - `check-contract` on the task contract: enforces the tier-minimum required
     set (superset rule) and, when `required_workflow` is `tdd`, non-empty
     `red_evidence` + `green_evidence` for every test-type check.
   - `check-traceability` on `specs/<feature>/traceability.json`: every
     REQ → AC → TEST → evidence chain is intact (required for `high`/`critical`).
   For `Done` tasks, validate
   `specs/<feature>/verification/<task-id>.evidence.json` with
   `check-evidence-bundle.(sh|ps1)` so the report, contract, and passing
   evidence artifacts are all bound together. For `high`/`critical` the bundle
   must carry `spec_revision`, `build_env`, and `review_verdict.verdict == PASS`;
   for `critical` it must additionally carry a verifiable HMAC `signature` and a
   clean tree (`git_generated_dirty == true` is a hard fail). Always produce the
   bundle with `generate-evidence-bundle.(sh|ps1)` — never hand-author sha256
   fields or the `git_commit` field. The runner binds the bundle to the current
   git commit and computes digests automatically.
7. For `refactor` and `bugfix` tasks with a `baseline-behavior.md`, apply
   `differential-test-policy.md` and classify every BL diff.
8. Run critical review with an isolated evaluator using `evaluation-rubric.md`.
   The evaluator must also apply `quality-gate-calibration.md`: deterministic
   command output, bundled scripted gates, line-level inspection, and manual
   artifacts outrank implementation-report claims; the implementation report
   never supports PASS by itself.
   When the change touches the relevant surface, the evaluator also applies the
   on-demand domain checklists — `security-checklist.md` (user input, auth,
   secrets, external systems, AI/LLM), `performance-checklist.md` (data access,
   hot paths, rendering), `accessibility-checklist.md` (user-facing UI), and
   `design-system-checklist.md` (user-facing UI in projects carrying a
   `design-system/` contract).
   Load a checklist only when its domain is in scope, to keep review context lean.
   On Claude Code use the `sdd-evaluator` subagent. On Codex use the shipped
   `sdd-evaluator` TOML agent; do not create new agent role files under
   `~/.codex/agents/`. Elsewhere, perform the review in a fresh session or a
   clearly separated critical-review pass.
   Before launch, persist a canonical allowed-input manifest containing exactly
   one `reports/implementation/<feature>/T-NNN.md`, the task's required
   specification and calibration files, and only those changed, test, contract,
   ADR, or deterministic-evidence files whose exact canonical path and lowercase
   SHA-256 pair appears in that implementation report's `## Outputs` table.
   Broad `plugins/`, `tests/`, `contracts/`, or `docs/adr/` membership never
   authorizes an evaluator input.
   Reverify every hash immediately before launch and bind the manifest path/hash,
   a fresh run ID, and a distinct host-session ID into the evaluator result.
   Persist a one-role `review-context-invocation/v2` manifest for the evaluator.
   Set its `task_id` to the current T-NNN and require the sole implementation
   report path, report heading, and `Task ID` field to match that exact task.
   Bind it to the current SHA-256 and final record hash of the canonical
   `reports/review-context/identity-ledger.json`. The ledger must already carry
   the invoking implementation identity and every earlier reviewer/evaluator
   reservation as a valid hash chain; never accept caller-supplied reserved-ID
   arrays as a substitute. Immediately before launch, atomically reserve the
   evaluator identity by running
   `scripts/validate-review-context-set.sh <manifest> <repository-root>
   --reserve` or
   `scripts/validate-review-context-set.ps1 -Manifest <manifest>
   -RepositoryRoot <repository-root> -Reserve`. Require `REVIEW_CONTEXT_OK`,
   then launch exactly the reserved evaluator run/session. A missing canonical
   ledger, stale chain tip, deterministic runtime, or any non-zero result
   retains `Implementation Complete` and blocks evaluator launch. This boundary
   validates only the evaluator being launched; it does not require fabricated
   future or replayed reviewer contexts.
   Reject a missing manifest, unlisted path, hash mismatch, chat-only input, or
   any implementation/review/evaluation session reuse.
   No same-session fallback is permitted for the evaluator.
   For `high`/`critical` tasks, record
   the evaluator's verdict as `review_verdict` in the evidence bundle;
   `check-evidence-bundle` requires `review_verdict.verdict == PASS`.
9. Classify findings as `Accepted`, `Rejected`, or `Deferred`.
10. Apply only safe fixes allowed by `auto-fix-policy.md`.
11. Repeat critical review for a maximum of 3 cycles.
    Stop earlier when the remaining issue requires human decision, missing
    evidence cannot be produced, or the fix belongs to `fix-by-review-ticket` or
    an upstream review loop. Do not downgrade a finding merely to end the loop.
12. For UI changes, use available browser or Playwright tooling to verify the
    rendered screen, DOM, and console, and when feasible perform the smoke
    run described in `deterministic-check-policy.md`.
13. Create review-ticket YAML for unresolved or non-auto-fixable findings.
14. Update traceability and detect drift using `integrity-policy.md`.
15. Create `reports/quality-gate/<timestamp>.md` naming the task id.

### Sudo Mode

If a valid `SDD_SUDO` flag file exists at the project root (see
`plugins/sdd-quality-loop/references/sudo-mode-policy.md`), routine **approval**
checkpoints auto-pass: record `Approval: Approved (sudo <ISO8601 UTC>)` in
tasks.md and continue. A `refactor`/`bugfix` BL diff classified `accepted` also
auto-passes (mark `(sudo <ISO8601 UTC>)` and update `baseline-behavior.md`).

Sudo never auto-passes genuine **judgment**: `requires_human_decision: true`
findings, architecture/auth/authz/breaking-API/security decisions, and a
`fix-required` baseline diff still stop the gate and require a human. All
deterministic gates apply; every check runs as normal.

## Done Decision

Set the task to `Done` only when:

- `check-risk` passes: valid tier + rationale, and `high`/`critical` declares
  `Required Workflow: tdd`
- `check-contract` passes: every required contract check (the tier-minimum
  superset) is true with existing evidence files; for `tdd`, test checks carry
  `red_evidence` + `green_evidence`
- `check-traceability` passes for `high`/`critical` (REQ → AC → TEST → evidence)
- `check-evidence-bundle` passes: the bundle names the report, contract, and
  contract-passing artifacts, with matching hashes and task id; for
  `high`/`critical` it carries `spec_revision`, `build_env`, and
  `review_verdict.verdict == PASS`; for `critical` it carries a verified HMAC
  `signature` over a clean tree
- for `critical`, a second distinct named approver recorded
  `Second Approval: Approved` (enforced by `check-task-state`; never sudo-bypassed)
- acceptance criteria have tests
- no unresolved Critical or Major finding remains
- required UI verification succeeds
- contracts and ADRs agree with the implementation
- traceability is current
- every in-scope "cannot verify" item has been resolved by evidence or recorded
  as a blocking review ticket

Otherwise set the task to `Blocked` or retain `Implementation Complete`, and
create review tickets. Do not commit, push, or create a PR/MR unless explicitly
requested.

## Post-Done: Automatic Retrospective

When the task transitions to `Done` (all conditions in the Done Decision section
are met), automatically invoke the retrospective flow:

1. Confirm `reports/quality-gate/<timestamp>.md` has been written (step 15 must
   complete first so the new report is included in retrospective metrics).
2. Determine the feature path from the task's spec directory (e.g. `specs/<feature>`).
3. Check `tasks.md` for the feature: if any task with `Approval: Approved` is not
   yet `Status: Done`, append
   `[INFO] retrospective deferred: N approved task(s) still pending Done`
   to the quality-gate report and stop here. Invoke retrospective only when
   every approved task in the feature is `Done`.
4. Invoke `workflow-retrospective` for that feature path:
   - Claude Code: `/sdd-quality-loop:workflow-retrospective specs/<feature>`
   - Codex: `Use the workflow-retrospective skill for specs/<feature>`
5. The retrospective runs in read-only mode and does not affect `Done` status or
   any other task field.
6. If the feature path cannot be determined, skip the retrospective and append a
   `[WARN] retrospective skipped: feature path unknown` line to the quality-gate
   report.

Do **not** invoke this flow when the gate exits with `Blocked` or retains
`Implementation Complete`.

## Common Rationalizations

The gate exists because generators grade their own work generously. Reject
these excuses — each one launders a claim into a `Done`.

- "The report says all tests pass, so they pass" — the report is a claim; rerun
  the checks and read the output yourself (`evaluation-rubric.md`).
- "The checks are green, the review can be light" — green checks do not cover
  spec compliance, untested acceptance criteria, or completion-faking.
- "This finding is probably fine, downgrade it to Minor" — never weaken a
  severity without recording why in the report.
- "A check doesn't apply, I'll just delete it from the contract" — mark it
  `required: false` with a non-empty `waiver_reason`; never remove a check to pass.
- "The evidence file is missing but the result is obviously right" — Default-FAIL:
  no saved evidence means the check stays false.
- "I cannot verify this, but no failure is visible" — cannot-verify is not PASS;
  keep the check false or create a review ticket.
- "sudo is on, so I can wave this through" — sudo auto-passes routine *approval*
  only; judgment findings and architecture/auth/security decisions still stop
  the gate.

## Red Flags

- Flipping a contract check to `passes: true` without a saved evidence path.
- A handler returning data shaped like the test fixture (completion-faking —
  `Critical`).
- Skipped/`todo`/`xit` tests covering in-scope behavior left unaddressed.
- An acceptance criterion with no test traced to it.
- Setting `Done` while a Critical or Major finding is unresolved.
- Running the critical review in the same context as the implementation.
