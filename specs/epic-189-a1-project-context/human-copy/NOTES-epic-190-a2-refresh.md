# Refresh note — regenerated against live 77/26 by epic-190-a2 (2026-08-11)

`MANIFEST.sha256` cannot carry prose (its parser rejects `#` comment lines
with exit 13), so this note records why six staged bytes in this bundle
changed without any change to this epic's own inventory.

## What happened

A human applied `epic-190-a2-capability-registry`'s human-copy bundle to the
live tree. That apply added seven paths to the shared, repository-wide
`PHASE2_TARGETS` tuple in `generate-guard-invariants.py`, moving live
`guard-invariants.json` from 70/19 to 77/26:

| Array | before | after |
|---|---|---|
| `protected_gate_suffixes` | 70 | 77 |
| `phase2_human_copy_targets` | 19 | 26 |

The seven added paths:

```
contracts/capability-registry.schema.json
contracts/capability-registry.json
contracts/lite-upgrade-reason-catalog.json
plugins/sdd-quality-loop/scripts/generate-gate-capabilities.py
plugins/sdd-quality-loop/scripts/generated/gate-capabilities.json
plugins/sdd-quality-loop/contracts/capability-registry.json
plugins/sdd-quality-loop/contracts/capability-registry.schema.json
```

This bundle still carried the pre-apply 70/19 bytes. Because these are
whole-file replacement candidates, applying this bundle would have **removed**
all seven paths from **both** arrays — silently un-protecting them. That is the
destructive-superset failure mode inverted, and it was live rather than
hypothetical.

## What changed here

Six files, refreshed to the now-live bytes, plus their six `MANIFEST.sha256`
digests updated in place (no manifest line added, removed, or reordered):

```
plugins/sdd-quality-loop/references/guard-invariants.json
plugins/sdd-quality-loop/scripts/generate-guard-invariants.py
plugins/sdd-quality-loop/scripts/generated/guard_invariants.py
plugins/sdd-quality-loop/scripts/generated/guard-invariants.generated.js
plugins/sdd-quality-loop/scripts/generated/guard-invariants.generated.ps1
plugins/sdd-quality-loop/scripts/generated/guard-invariants.generated.sh
```

The four `generated/` siblings were produced by running the real
`generate-guard-invariants.py` against a scratch copy of this bundle's own
tree — never hand-authored. Non-vacuity was demonstrated by tampering with each
generated output and the canonical JSON in turn, confirming `--check` exits 1,
then restoring and confirming exit 0.

**Nothing in this epic's own inventory changed.** `EPIC_A1_TARGETS` and this
bundle's 28 manifest paths are untouched; the seven new paths land inside the
`PHASE2_TARGETS` block of the generator's composition order
(`BASELINE_SUFFIXES + PHASE2_TARGETS + EPIC_A1_TARGETS`), so this epic's
28-path tail of `protected_gate_suffixes` is preserved exactly.

## Safety property

Applying this bundle to the current live tree is a no-op on both arrays:

| Array | live before | post-apply | removals |
|---|---|---|---|
| `protected_gate_suffixes` | 77 | 77 | **0** |
| `phase2_human_copy_targets` | 26 | 26 | **0** |

Verified: `generate-guard-invariants.py --check` exits 0 and
`shasum -a 256 -c MANIFEST.sha256` exits 0 (18/18 OK).

`tests/guard-invariants-epic-a1.tests.{sh,ps1}` — which encodes exactly this
"staged equals live, or staged equals live-plus-manifest" invariant — returns
to green as a result: 81/0 (sh) and 85/0 (ps1), with no assertion edited.
